# üß© Recordings - websocket based full-stack application

A full-stack application with a WebSocket-based Java backend and a Vue 3 frontend.  
This repository contains two separate parts:

- `server/`: Spring Boot backend with WebSocket support
- `client/`: Vue 3 frontend using Vite

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

### Backend (`server/`)

Configuration is handled via `application.properties`.  
A sample config file is available as:  
üìÑ `server/src/main/resources/application.example.properties`

You can copy it to `application.properties` and customize it as needed:

```properties
# Logging config
logging.level.org.springframework=INFO

# H2 database connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=

# H2 Console (optional)
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
```

### Frontend (`client/`)

The frontend requires a WebSocket endpoint to communicate with the backend.

A sample environment file is available as:
üìÑ `client/.env.example`

Copy it to `.env` and set the correct backend WebSocket URL:

```properties
VITE_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

## üöÄ Running the App

You can start the app either manually or using Docker Compose.

Set up the [environment variables](#-environment-variables) for both options.

---

### üß≠ Option 1: Manual Startup

**Backend (Spring Boot)**  
Navigate to the `server/` directory and run:

- `./mvnw spring-boot:run`  
  *or* run `Application.java` from your IDE.

The backend will be available at:  
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If the H2 console is enabled, access it at:  
[http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

---

**Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)**  
Navigate to the `client/` directory and run:

- `npm install`  
- `npm run dev`

The frontend will be available at:  
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

### üê≥ Option 2: Docker Compose

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

From the project root, run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build and start the backend (Spring Boot)
- Build and start the frontend (Vite)

The app will be available at:  
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
- Backend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop the containers:  
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To also remove volumes (e.g. if switching DB setup):  
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## üß± Technical Architecture & Design Decisions

This project was designed with simplicity and demonstrability in mind. Below are the key architectural choices:

### üîå WebSocket-based Communication

The UI (Vue 3 frontend) communicates with the backend (Spring Boot) using **WebSocket**, utilizing the **STOMP protocol** on top.

- This enables real-time, bidirectional communication.
- STOMP provides a lightweight message format and supports topics/subscriptions.
- _(Note: In most cases ‚Äî including this one ‚Äî REST would have been a simpler and more straightforward choice.)_

### üóÑÔ∏è In-Memory H2 Database

The backend uses an **H2 in-memory database**, which is:

- Lightweight and requires no external setup.
- Automatically populated with a small amount of test/demo data on startup.
- Ideal for quick demos or proof-of-concept implementations.
- _(Note: All data is lost when the application stops ‚Äî it's not intended for production use.)_

### üîê No Authentication or Authorization

To keep the architecture simple and focused on core features, **authentication and authorization were deliberately left out**.

- In a real-world scenario, user access control would be essential.
- This project focuses on technical interactions rather than security layers.

### üß† Frontend State Management

The frontend uses **local state management** to:

- Track and organize domain entities.
- Optimize ongoing processes (e.g., workflows or interactive states).
- Avoid redundant API/WebSocket calls and improve responsiveness.
